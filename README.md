## Liquidhandler Robot 
@author: Konstantinos Lagogiannis 

This project provides part of the resources required to make an automated pipetting machine (robot)
that can be used in biology labs or just for fun.

The project describes the hardware  and assembly requirements  
along with the electronic and code components to build a gantry robot on which a 
standard pipeteman can be mounted.

The original idea is based on opentrons, ot.one however this design is heavily modified and simplified on the the controller side as it  does not require a connected PC to run. This also means it does not provide the all the functionality and flexibility of the OT.ONE software platform. It can be used as a simple platform to run repetitive procedures that can be coded on the controller or saved on a SD card. 


However, at this stage only the controller code is publicably available on this repository.
The code is part of an opensource project I wish to make on an affordable lab pipetting robot that can mount a standard lab pipette. 

A video of the prototype can be found here : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlGT0nzT_E8

The provided version of the code operates the prototype  and can provide the basis for future development. However, I have yet to provide sufficient documantation for thise project , and thus thus this holds back release to the public domain as a complete open project which I can share.
